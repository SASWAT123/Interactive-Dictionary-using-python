"# Interactive-Dictionary-using-python" 
It is a very basic python dictionary. When the user enters any word, he/she will get the meaning of that word.

There are three conditions for this:
1. If the user inputs the exact word which is in the dictionary.
2. If the user inputs word in which their is some spelling mistake i.e., rainn instead of rain.
3. If the user inputs something like 'jdfklasjf' which dosen't exist.

Currently all the words in the dictionary are imported from the data.json file. You can expand it according to your wish.

Enjoy!
